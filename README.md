## 🔍 About Me

I'm a result-driven QA/SDET professional with 4+ years of experience in ensuring software quality across web, mobile, and API platforms. I specialize in creating robust automation frameworks, reducing manual testing efforts, and accelerating release cycles.

Currently, I’m enhancing my skills in advanced automation, cloud testing, and backend validation while exploring hands-on projects with tools like Selenium, Cypress, REST-assured, Jenkins, Docker, and more.
